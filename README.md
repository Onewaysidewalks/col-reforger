# Col Reforger

Hate reforging in Crusaders of light? This is the tool for you!

Simply ...

- clone/download this repository
- change the `reforger.yaml` to which stats you want to reforge for if needed. (The default is 2 skill roll, with 100 max attempts to get)
- make sure your CoL window is open to a screen that looks like this:

- open the command prompt or powershell window to this directory, and run `./gradlew reforge` 

Note: make sure the command prompt window does not overlap with the CoL window.

Once the program detects your desired, it will stop!

## WARNING: Only Warrior is supported at the moment
